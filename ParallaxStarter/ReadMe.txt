ReadMe for cis580 game project 7 - Hectic Helicopter

For this game the initial requirements were to implement parallax scrolling.
Initially I wanted to create an underwater submarine type game unfortuneately I couldn't create or find great art for it. Additionally, the lab took a bit longer to understand and complete than anticipated.

Therefore, I hereby present you with Hectic Helicopter. It uses art from the lab as well as some available reuseable art.

To move use either the arrow keys or w-a-s-d, and dodge the floating rocks. If you are able to manuver through all of them without colliding you win! Otherwise, if you crash you burn.
	- however since the collisions and game ending screens are broken it doesn't quite matter where you fly, but the parallax scrolling works!
